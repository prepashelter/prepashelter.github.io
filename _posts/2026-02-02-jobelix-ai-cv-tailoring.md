Applying online is broken.

If you **don’t tailor your CV**, you’re rejected.  
If you **do tailor it**, you’re ignored anyway, and you just lost 20 minutes.

That’s why we built **Jobelix**.

**Jobelix** is a desktop tool that automatically **adapts your CV and application answers to each LinkedIn job**, based on the job description,  without spamming generic resumes.

You define your full background once (projects, skills, education).  
For every job, Jobelix selects only what’s relevant and applies for you.

It’s currently in **beta**, with a freemium model and support for Linux and Windows.
